# STL Files for the Educational Mobile Robot Prototype
This directory contains the STL files used for 3D printing the prototype presented in the article:
**"Construction of an Educational Prototype of a Differential Wheeled Mobile Robot"**  
Authors: Celso MÃ¡rquez-SÃ¡nchez, et al.
Journal: *Hardware* (MDPI)

## ðŸ“¦ Included Files
Each STL file corresponds to a specific part of the robot's chassis or structure:

- `chasis.stl`: Main body of the robot. Serves as the structural base where all other components such as motors, wheels, electronics, and supports are mounted.
- `cover.stl`: Top cover of the robot, used to protect internal components such as the battery, wiring, and controller board.
- `ballCasterBase.stl`: Support structure for a front ball caster, used to stabilize the robot and allow smooth movement along the floor.
- `shaftCoupling.stl`: Coupling piece designed to connect the motor shaft to the wheel or drive axle, ensuring secure transmission of torque.
