# Demonstration Videos â€“ Educational Mobile Robot Prototype
This folder contains three video files demonstrating the physical execution of different reference trajectories by the educational mobile robot prototype described in the article:
**"Construction of an Educational Prototype of a Differential Wheeled Mobile Robot"**  
Authors: Celso MÃ¡rquez-SÃ¡nchez, et la.
Journal: *Hardware* (MDPI)

## Description of Videos
Each video corresponds to a specific trajectory generated by the Jetson and followed by the robot using its onboard control system:
- `linear_trajectory.mp4`:  
  The robot moves in a straight path at constant velocity. This demonstrates the basic tracking performance of the system for a linear reference.
- `circular_trajectory.mp4`:  
  The robot follows a circular path, validating the control system's ability to track a continuously curving trajectory.
- `sinusoidal_trajectory.mp4`:  
  The robot executes a sinusoidal path, showing the systemâ€™s performance under varying curvature and more complex movement patterns.

> All videos were recorded in real-time conditions with the system described in the article, including the Jetson-based controller and 3D-printed chassis.

Due to file size limitations, the trajectory tracking videos are hosted externally on YouTube.
Each video shows the robot executing a specific reference trajectory in real time:
